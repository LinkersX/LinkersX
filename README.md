Linkers::X a Lightning Fast Event Driven HFT Algorithmic Trading API with Object Oriented Trading Language.


Are you tired of porting your trading strategies back and forth from MetaTrader to NinjaTrader & cTrader && SierraChart?

Are you tired that after 15 years we are still playing aroung with half baked trading platforms, 
and there is always a string attached, linke no tick charts, no tick barTypes, slow or non existent replay, not possible back test with multiple timeframes?

LinkersX is 100% tick based Event Driven Trading API with easy to learn trading language with built in over 100 trading signals.
Although LinkersX perfectly integrates into any of the previously mentioned trading platforms, 
LinkersX is fully abstracted from its host Trading platforms , has its own tick and bar processing algorithm rewritten from scratch in C++.
